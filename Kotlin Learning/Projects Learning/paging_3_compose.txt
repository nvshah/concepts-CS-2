* Paging3 & COmpose & UnnSplashAPI

DI : dependency injection 
 \
  - Inject Repository In View


=> Paginating Lib means that When we request some api, we do not need to add 'page=2' like query param
  that query will be automatically added & handled by Paging Library (with Retrofit as well as ROOM Db)

  Remote Mediator :- is useful class from Paging 3 Library

NOTE
 - You will be able to achive pagination for your Room DB just by mentioning the PagingSource
   as ROOM lib supports Paging lib under it.
   So we do not need to do all boring stuff rather just mention the PagingSource<> & rest all
   work will be taken care by ROOM library


Steps :-

1) Create Network Module for DI (of Network Classes & Services)
2) Create Table for RemoteKeys (used by Remote Mediator to auto-inject 'page=2' query)
3) Create necessary DAO's & Database
4) Create Databse Module for DI
