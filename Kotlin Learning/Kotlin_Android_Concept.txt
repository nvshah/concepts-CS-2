-> MainActivity is itself context

-> Views Object are accessible until setContentView() is called

   View Objects are found by unique id given to View in XML.

-> Vector Drawable Suppor (Android X)  

     app:srcCompat    [:- compatibility for older versions of android]

-> Note: A constraint in the context of the Layout Editor represents a connection or alignment of a view to another view, 
        the parent layout, or an invisible guideline.


* Attributes (Imp) - User Experience - accessibility guidelines

  importantForAccessibility

- ImageViews should have a content description to help make your app more accessibles.


* Data Binding : 
  __________
  - depraved of using findViewId() [Not relying on deep heirarchy at runtime]
  - connect activity or layout to a fragment to compile time instead of run time.
  - Compiler generate Binding Class (at compile time) , which we can use to find View without any overhead
  
  It's imp topic to master (that enclose JetPack)


  Simple Features -> use View Bindings   [ref- https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/view-binding]
  Advance features -> use Data Binding

* Others (UI)

Ratio - Width:height ratio, auto calculated by providing atleast 1 val. 
Chains - help to create view groups


* fragment :
  --------
   -> Can manually inflate layout, which is independednt of onCreate()
   
* Navigation :
  ------
   - Back Stack  [between activities]
   - Fragment Back Stack [between fragments under same activities]

   Nav-Directions :
  -----
   - safe pass of arguments between fragments, (Bundle) 

   Navigation Interface :
  ----
   - provides 1 api, that listen when navigation changes

   NavHostFragment : 


   => To pass argument via navigation from in xml :-

       <fragment> <argument> ... all details for argument ... </argument>   </fragment>
   


* Menu :
  ---
   - Menu are created in method called onCreatedOptionsMenu()
   - Much like layouts you need to inflate Menu


* Intents :
  ----
   - Navigation between activity
     -> Implicit : beware of fact that where to target the intent
                   Each implicit intetn must have an action
                  certain { action, Category, datatype }

            For launcher activity it has to register in manifest with correct intent-filter

   Implicit Intent -> Launches an activity based upon parameters, such as action, data, and data type.
   Explicit Intent -> Launches an activity based upon its class name

   Compat - makes less boiler plate code to share something via intent

   NOTE : If no intent activity are found then it may crash tha app.

   => The packageManager knows every activity register in manifest across every application.
      So it can be used to check if implicit intent resolve to something. 


  Share Implicit Intent :
  ------
   -  shareCompat to create our share Implicit intent.

* Life-Cycle :
  -------
   - Every Activity & Every Fragments have a Life-Cycle
   -> To manage activity or fragment you need to know your current state 

   Android Activity State & OS

   onStart, onStop -> Visibility
   onResume, onPause -> Focus

   onCreate -> 1 time initialization, (inflation binding)
   onDestroy -> final tear down 

   onPause -> blocks UI from drawing (no interaction)
   onRestart -> Anything that runs if only being not created

   => onCreate or onRestart will be called when activity became visible 


   Android LifeCycle Object :
   ----------
   -> this object can be queried for the state.
    
    LifeCycleOwner :- A class that has a life cycle (Activity & Fragment)
    LifeCycleObserver :- allow to observe LifeCycleOwner

    LifeCycle library classes can be used to notify something (with Observer Patterns) 


    Observer Patterns :   [Philosophy/Paradigms/Principle]
    ------

    LifeCycleObserver :
    -----------
     -> It listen & react via a syntax of `Annotation` 
     - Every Activity has property : lifeCycle

* Application Class :
  -----
   - main class that contains global application state for your entire app.

* Save State to Bundle (manually) :
  -------
   - Bundle : Collection of Key-Value pair.

   - OnSaveInstanceState()   // callback that occur whenever android os try to stop/kill app in background
      \
       It's called after onStop().
        - Safety measure when app is torn down by OS

  - OnRestoreInstanceState() // callback 
     \ 
      It's called after onStart()

  
  * Parcel & Parcelable :
    ----------
     Parcelable is interface

     using parcel in android for processes is similar as using xml/json for web-services.

     App Bundle -> Is kinda Parcelable

     Parcelable Interface :
       scribeContents() : used by android to share active file descriptors by processes.

       => IMP : order is importent, while parceling. [i.e Read/Write/to/from Parcels]

       Q. How to Parcelize data class ??
       -> @Parcelize,   [from kotlin-android-extension ]

      @Parcelize :
      -------
       -> Turns a Kotlin data object with simple and Parcelable types into a Parcelable object.

----
TIPS ->
----

Extract constants string in Resource Value
        style that is commonly used in most widget into Resource style


To match app theme (use below in xml)
       - widget.AppCompat.Button.colored    [Use Button color from theme]


To add listener to navigation backstack
    addOnDestinationChangedListener(),
    DrawerLockMode

->  Retrieve and use the data (from OnRestoreInstanceState) in onCreate if you're restarting to Activity


Amazing Info 
-----------

-> Buttons are an extension of TextView

-> To interact with Fragment/Activity LifeCycle, We can have 2 ways
    1) Overriding methods (i.e create(), start(), stop(), pause(), etc...)
    2) AndroidLifeCycle object

* Bundle & App-State Info (Implicit & Explicit Bundling) :-
-> When androis OS stop/destroy any of app activity or app itself, it save some states of app into `Bundle`,
   which can be later utilised when restarted.

   It can trace - text, labels, even BackStack Information ...
  
   hint : most time it will try to bundle the information that has ID's associated with it

   When return back to app - it try to reads from BUNDLE 
   => Sometimes You need to manually add info to bundle (i.e manual saving state info)

-> When app is switch between Potrait-Landscape mode, Configuration Change, i.e Activity Rebuilds 
   LifeState - 
     OnDestroy -> OnCreate -> onStart -> ...

-> To kill any activity ;- finish()
