1. Basics 1
------------

* Activity := Each screen (in android) is known as an Activity and is built around a single task
   - Android Studio hooks up your layout (ie root layout) so you dont need to manually do so

* In the most general sense, any logic you add must come after calling setContentView()

- CountDownTimer, Toast

* LogCat -> Convention : ClassName + LogMessage

* Orientation| Configuration Changes :-
  ---------
  1. save any properties for Activity specified by the developer
  2. destroys the Activity
  3. Recreates the Activity for the new orientation by calling onCreate(), which resets any properties specified by the developer.

  Configuration Change :- when device lang change

  onSaveInstanceState() ->
    - called before configuration change happens, giving you chance to save anything imp.

  Bundle -> hashmap, which Android uses to pass values across different screens

* View Binding :
  - Technique to make layout available in code behind without using `findViewById()`
    \
     To reference Views instead of findViewById()

  - binding obj then can be used to bind data to the view

* Layout Inflater :
  - LayoutInflater is a system utility used to instantiate (or "inflate")
    a layout XML file into its corresponding View objects.


* Activities & Communication :
  ---------
  -> Keep an activity for single task (to avoid confusion in your App)
  -> When you create new Activity (Fragment | ViewModel), another place is also modified
     i.e manifest file


* AndroidManifest :
  ---
  3 main tags

  1) manifest tag :- root element
        -> Your package only must be associated with this tag

  2) application tag :-
        -> contains app-sepcific information  {icon, name, theme}

  3) activity tag :
       Every Activity within app must have corresponding tag in the AndroidManifest file
