Common -> math module 
          %, log(), divmod(), //, 
          floor(), ceil(), round() 


* Use `Log` function :
  -----------
   -> When you want to grow or downfall exponentially on some base


AMAZING QUE : Why -ve num can't be base ??

  -> https://www.kristakingmath.com/blog/why-cant-logarithms-be-negative#:~:text=So%200%2C%201%2C%20and%20every,the%20base%20of%20the%20logarithm


* use 'math.sqrt()' or 'math.isqrt()' function :
  ----------
   -> 

* range [1, n] given : use Cyclic sort

* for rhs set bit :- n & -n 
  for checking if num is power of 2 :- n & (n-1)


* To reverse a bit :- Do XOR i.e `^`

* sliding windows for long size array

* use dummy node in case of array or linked list to cover edge cases

* Use Heap DS to find something like Kth largest or smallest element 

* heapq lets you fetch top t of n items in O(t+n) time

* bisect let you fetch a range from sorted list or array using binary search
  
* Tree problems can be solved in 2 ways :- 1) Decision Tree 
                                           2) backtracking

* Subset Kinda Problem 2 ways :- 1) Explore & backtrack 
                                 2) Processed & UnProcessed

                                 3) Include & Exclude
                                 4) Recursion Memoized

* Sliding Window problem can be well suited with the 2 pointers method

* Top k fequent elements :- Counter or heap or Bucket Sort

* Use tuple :- when order matters 
      frozenset :- when order not matters 

* When need to work through rows & cols of matrix, 
  then just create Hash-Set of Rows & Columns seperately

* Stack -> Monotonic Incr/Decr Stack 

* While using LinkedList | Queue :- use dummmy pointer to get rid off edge cases 
     
* Cheapest Path in Graph (esp Directed) :- Bellman-Ford

* You can use lograthmic identity & properties alongwith n-dimensional matrix (ie Tensor)
  to solve the complex parallel problems
   \
    -> Where each dimen of Matrix will grow Logarithmically


* You can consider `deque` Data Structure instead of 2 Pointers in some cases as replacement/alternative
