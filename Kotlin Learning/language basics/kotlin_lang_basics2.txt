* Asynchronous PROGRAMMING :
  -----------------------
-------
NOTE 

-> Java threads are OS-level threads & consumes significant amount of System resources 

-------

* Coroutine & Threads :
  ----

* Threads := 
   - One Execution Flow, which sequentially performs the commands in single thread.
   - inderterminate & it depends on whatever is going on in your CPU at the time you run.
   - don't wait for each other to complete

  Problem with Thread (in java) :
   - Java threads are OS-level threads & consumes significant amount of System resources 
   - You can’t create thousands of threads as you’ll likely end up with an 
     `OutOfMemoryError` thrown by the JVM.
   
   - It's controlled by OS

* Coroutine :
  ----
   - Primararily, its a Computation
   - A lightweight Thread
   - It can be suspended & resumed at specific point of computation without bothering(blocking) the thread 
   - It can be controlled by Programmer's Code

   - Suspension is efficiennt operation, so you can even create thousands of Coroutine

=> These suspending functions can only be invoked from coroutines or other suspending functions, 
   as well as functions inlined in either coroutines or suspending routines.

* Coroutine vs Thread :
  ----
   -> when using coroutines, threads are still used under the hood
   -> But one thread can execute thousands of coroutines.

   -> Therefore, you don’t spend precious memory resources to manipulate a large number of coroutines.

* Connfiguring :
  ----

  CoroutineScope:- does nothing except providing CoroutineContext to Coroutine

  CoroutineContext :- provide info such as Job, Dispatcher(thread related info), ExceptionHandler

  Jobs :- background tasks, (independent tasks)
  Dispatcher :- The Spawner of Coroutine (ie Thread)

  [REMEMBER]
   -> Inorder to launch a Coroutine, you need to Obtain a Scope 

  Scopes :- GlobalScope, MainScope, CoroutineScope 

  Coroutine Builders :-
    - create nnew Coroutine inside specified CoroutineScope/Context
    - Eg runBlocking(), launch()


* Deferred vs Job :
  ---
   Deferred :-  Contains async result once ready
   Job  :- allows you to create new Coroutine to perform some async tasks


* LaunchedEffect :
  ----
   - Same as initState() in Flutter Stateful Widget
     LaunchedEffect is same in Composable Function
