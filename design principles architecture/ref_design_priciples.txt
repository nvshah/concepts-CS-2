* SOLID :
  -----
    -> https://www.educative.io/blog/solid-principles-oop-c-sharp

   Open-Closed Principle :
   -----
    -> One Way Flow (Extend only & cannot modify)
      
      Through polymorphism, we can extend our parent entity to suit the needs of the child entity 
      while leaving the parent intact.

    -> Open-Closed in my terms :
      --------
       Let Say a math teacher has create a class for Some theorems he invented.
       Then the disciples will use those theorems in exams .

       Now after some years, math teacher discovered new rules on top of those theorems.
       But He has to modify some of his prev theorems to utilise new foundings.
       So he cannot change original(standard) one which is used by many of his students.

       Indeed He can create new Journal/Publish new way So that New students can adapt it in new way
       & old students can adapt if they want otherwise stick to that old theorems.

       Eg2 - Consider Programming languages instead of theorem.

   DI :
   ----
     DIP is that decoupled programs require less work to change

     Contract - Way :-
     " Classes that perform actions or functionality should not depend on the Classes doing the work, 
     it SHOULD DEPEND on an abstraction of that class "

    -> Data (low-level) & Business logic(High-level) both must depends on abstractions of model 
       [Loose Coupling]


* Inheritance vs Composition :
  ------------------
   Inheritance -> compile time  (classes)
   Composition -> Run Time   (objects)
