__________________________________________

Event Loop :
--------
 -> Isolates vs Threads 
     isolates do not share memory while threads may can

    So how to communicate ??
     -> message


  1) non async functions/methods/code blocks 
  2) Futures 
  3) Isolates 

  Futures : (async/await)
  _______ 
   -> allows you to queue execution of code block in the event loop

   -> It will give event loop a chance to execute the other events/tasks.

     1) Future() :- enques directly 
     2) Future.delayed() :- wait fot t seconds before enqueing


  Isolates :
  ________ 
   -> rely on input & output 
   -> compute heavy logics & not intend to interrupt the UI thread

    - Compute 
    - SendPort & RecievePort

   -> Every isolate has its own event loop & own memory, which parent even also not allowed
      to access.

    1) Compute : (Way 1)
       ------
        - hides the messaging the mechanisms

    2) Isolate.spawn()  (way 2)


   Q)) Advantage of not having Shared Memory ??
   -> Memory Allocation & Garbage Collection don't require locking.
