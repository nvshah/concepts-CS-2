=> java supports & working on Unicode values by default


When performing arithmetic operations, Java internally promote to widening conversion if required
  i.e (implicit conversion)

  Eg byte a = 500
     byte b = 400
     int c = a * b / 20  // here a * b is promoted to int 

  character can be implicitly converted to integer //Automatic Type Conversion
