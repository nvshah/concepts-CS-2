* State management :
  ---
   - Way to access the state of some part from another part of an app 

* Built in Mechannisms :-
   |
    - Provider, ValueNotifierProvider  // InheritedWidget
      Streams

* What is Diff between State Mgmt & StateFul Widget ??
 -> 
   Stateful Widget := have state(logic) + UI 
     |
     - here the state is local pertaining to that specific widet only.
     - You still dont have convenient way of accessing the state of other widgets 

   Thus there are 2 types of States :
       \
        - Local & gLobal 

   1) Local State :
      ----
       - State limited to particular Widget (Eg StatefulWidget)

   
   2) Global State :
      ----
       - State that can be shared by multiple Widgets of an app !
       - Eg :- User (logged in) details
                \
                 as user info is required at diff places in same app (ie checkout, profile, cart, ...)

[TIPs]
=> Decouple UI from Business logic 
    \
     this can be achieved by seperating local state into Seperate Class 

[REMEMBER]
=> Private variable declare by leading underscore can be accessed by other file unless its declared inside library
   |
   ie library libName;   // At Top 


* Global State & Injection :
  -----------------------
   - Global State needs to be injected via Depedency Injection / Service Locator 

   Eg Provider, getIt, RiverPod


* Depedency Injection | Service Locator :
  -----------------------
   - At it core, it comprises of 2 things 
     1) list of instances 
     2) list of constructors (ie Factories) { to create those instances }

     & Some Manipulations method to play with above 2 variables 
        \
         get, register, reset, ...

--------

* Store state Mgmt Mechanism :
  ----
   -> Store<T> abstract class 
        |
        that uses ValueNotifier to manage state of type T
