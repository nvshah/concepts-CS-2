---- TIPS ---

=> Sometimes Linear Layout with Weight is a good choice rather than relative layout.



1) ConstraintsLayout :
     - For more commplex layout
     - useful to adapt to different screen sizes

     -> guidelines  : use guideline when you want to align child relative to Constraint Layout

     -> Chains :- Evenly Spread

     -> Qualifiers :- to adapt to different screen sizes or other qualifiers based layouts
