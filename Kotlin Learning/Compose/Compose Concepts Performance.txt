Compose Concepts Performance
---------------


* Stability & Compose :
  ---------------
  There is a concept of Stable Class & Not a Stable Class

  - Stable class are those one whose public fields are stable (ie All the primitive fields are stable)
  - You can consider immutable obj also similar to stable obj

  Now when Composable gets any parameter & if that parameter is stable
  then
  Compose will compare that stable fields with previous state of composable & if that changes
  then only it will Recompose otherwise not !


* Keys Lambda :
  ----
  key(id){
    Composable()
  }

  -> this will recompose your Composable only when id changes
