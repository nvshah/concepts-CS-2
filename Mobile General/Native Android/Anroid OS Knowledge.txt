Anroid OS
----------

* Every Android Project needs Gradle to build its project
  |
  Now Gradle comes with different versions
  |
  Every Gradle needs Java So Every Gradle also somehow tightened to Java version

  Eg Inorder to use Lambda Expression You need atleast Java8 (ie source 8) ie 1.8
     &
     Corresponding gradle version needs to be 3.0 or higher

     Hence Compiling Options of your Android Project depends on
      - Gradle version as well
      - source 7 | source 8 | ...

* Every Android OS version also has its own API-Level associated
