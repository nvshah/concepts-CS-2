1. Notes Remember
----------------

* placeholder
   - to inject any integer into your text values => “%1$d”

* First Activity in app -> AppCompatActivity

* Put layout created on Device Screen -> setContentView()

* In the most general sense, any logic you add must come after calling setContentView()

* your Activity can get destroyed and recreated several times while the user is using the app

* Anything you do in Android Native is in Activity
  So intent also need some activity to launch itself
