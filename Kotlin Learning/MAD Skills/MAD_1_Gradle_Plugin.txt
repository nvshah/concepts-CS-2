   Android-Gradle plugin :
   ----
   Android comes with pre-defined plugins & these plugins can build project gradle

   To tell android : that i am building android application // com.android.application

   - android DSL  //  helps to customise the build files

  -> gradle dependency management supports maven
      maven dependency -> to gradle
  
  Gradle runs in 3 phase ;
    1) initialisation : gradle decides which project instance needs to be done 

    2) configuration : evaluates all build scripts or the projects included in build 
                        apply plugins
                        register tasks

    3) Execution : gradle executes set of tasks needed for build

  Gradle DSL supports groovy or kotlin scripts for build file

* Gradle :- Helps in build tools scripting 

* Plugins & Tasks :
  ----------
   -> you can define your own plugins 
       \
        you can register tasks in that plugin 

      then you can run that Plugins from Gradle File (ie Every time when build is triggered)
