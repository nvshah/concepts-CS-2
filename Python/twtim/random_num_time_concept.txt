* random numbers are not random in python :
  ----------------

  -> It's actually Pseudo Random Number generator under the hood.
     (It's not truly random number generator)

  -> You can control random sequence you get based on seed
      \
       reason is that `seed` is actually starting value for generating a random number

    How Pseudo random number generator works ??

    -> It starts at seed value and applky some deterministic fun to generate random values.

    So if we start at same seed we get exact same seq every time.

    Eg MineCraft


  => Random Seed
     ----------
      -> A random seed (or seed state) is a number or vector used to initialise the pseudo random number generator.


    What is by default used by seed ??
     -> It's current time.

     i.e System Time as random seed.
