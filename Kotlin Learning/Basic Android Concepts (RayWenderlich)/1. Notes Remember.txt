1. Notes Remember
----------------

=> Basic Android Project is identified by ?
   -> app gradle file (for dependency)
   -> mainfest file  (hold basic meta info about app)  }-> app/src/main

=> Without AndroidManifest.xml, android refuses to run your App


* placeholder
   - to inject any integer into your text values => “%1$d”

* First Activity in app -> AppCompatActivity

* Put layout created on Device Screen -> setContentView()

* In the most general sense, any logic you add must come after calling setContentView()

* your Activity can get destroyed and recreated several times while the user is using the app

* Anything you do in Android Native is in Activity
  So intent also need some activity to launch itself

* From Camera You will get data often in `BitMap`

* In case of View Binding, always build the project first (ie Green Hammer)

* Don't hard code all things You can use strings.xml to store strings & likewise

* Every Activity within app must have corresponding tag in the AndroidManifest file

* If you want ViewModel to be shared between Activity & Fragment
  requireActivity().get(ClassName::class.java)
  instead of
  ViewModelProvider(this).get(ClassName::class.java)
