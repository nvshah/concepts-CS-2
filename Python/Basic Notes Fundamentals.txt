* Stack vs Heap ;
  -----
   in Python 
     to compare reference equality :- `is`
    & to compare value equality   :- `==`


* Tuple & Copy :
  ---------
   - When you create a tuple from another tuple then same tuple object is referred (ie Canonical Form)
   - There is no point in creating a Shallow Copy of an immutable obj so thus its just making a copy of reference

* Positional & Keyword Args :
  -----
   * to seperate the positional & keyword only

   /  -> any argument before slash needs to be positional only 
         afterwards it can be positional or keyword

   
   def f(pos_only, /, pos_or_kw, *, kw_only)

   slash (/) at end :- meanns everything positional
   start (*) at front :- means everything is Keyword onlys

   normal func are better thab pos args &
   pos arg are better than kw-args
