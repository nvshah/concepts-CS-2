Json Serialization
--------------

-> Json Encoding & Decoding for Dictionary Obj doesnt ensure the preserving of Key Order

-> Json Keys muste string only

-> In python null (in Json) is decoded as None

-> As Json needs its keys manadatory to be "String"
   You can use dict() function or constructor while creating dictionary object that needs to be serialized

-> We can use vars(), whilst encoding the object to json
                \
                As it comprises of dict from object's properties.
