=> State inn Compose (ie func) needs to be Remembered (MIMP property)

=> Hois State to altleast lowest Common ancestor of its consumers

=> UI behaviour logic should always live in Composition

=> View Model can be used as State Holder for State that is governed by the business Logics

=> Prefer Lambda Modifiers when frequenetly Changing States

* Recomposition 
  -----------
    There are 2 things for Compsable i.e 
     1) InitComposition
     2) ReComposition 

    Composable function can have state i.e mutable or immutable (mutableStateOf)

    It remembers this state using `by remember` deferred variable

    * Intelligent ReComposition :
      -----
       -> Skips those which not changed.

    NOTE :- 1) Composable Function can execute in any order 
            2) Composable functions can execute in parallel   [i.e take advantage of multiple cores]
            3) ReComposition skips as many Composable functions & lambdas as possible.
            4) ReComposition is optimistic & can be cancelled.
            5) A Composable function might run frequently, as often as every frame of seconds.


    1) execute any order :
      ----
       Composable decides that if some UI elements are in higher order & required drawing them first.

    
    * by remember & mutableStateOf() :
      ------
       -> Allows you to unwrap mutableStateOf() string in normal strin value using property 
          delegator i.e `by remember`

          So using `by` keyword you do not need to type variableName.toString() explicitly

          remember : 
           ----
            -> this function will save single obj in memory (initial composition)
               & saved val will return during recomposition

          mutableStateOf(variable) :
           ----
            -> variable is transformed into state & state is observed by Compose
               i.e whenever variable changes Compose will be notified & part of Compsable fun will be updated becuase of ReComposition process.

    * rememberSavable :
      ------
       -> Survive Activity LieCycle Changes such as Orientation Changes 

       
* Stateful Composition & Stateless Composable : 
  --------------------------------------

  State Hoisting : 
  --------
   -> Pattern to convert stateful Composable to stateless composable .
   -> Decoupled the state from Stateful Composable, by passing event as param to Composable function.


  * ViewModel :
    ------
     -> ViewModel will survive Configuration Changes, So they hold state for Composable fun 
        
     -> Should expose state in an Observable manner such as LiveData or StateFlow 
    
     -> Can Achieve Single Source of Truth.


     => .observaAsState()
        --------
         -> To observe state in ViewModel 


* UniDirectionl Flow : 
  ----------
   State flows from ViewModels to Screen 
   Event Flows from Screen to ViewModel.


* Coil :
  --- 
    rememberImagePainter()
      \
       builder -> It's a stack of composable (as far as my knowledge)


* State Holder :
  -------
   Instead of remembering state directly in composable,
     Use Class for that purpose

     Such class are known as State Holder

     State Holder also often resides & live the life-cycle of composable function


* Composition Local :
  -----
   = same as Provider in Flutter
   = accessing the Parent property via context in Flutter (same concept)

   compositionLocalOf{}
   CompositionLocalProvider()
   LocalContext 


--------

* items() => ListView in Flutter

* Composition has 3 Phases :- { Composition, Layout, Draw }

  Composition :- determines what to show
  Layout :- takes the composition & identify where on screen to show
  Draw :- draws on screen

=> Prefer Lambda Modifiers when frequenetly Changing States

   With lambda modifier, composition not change & we can avoid Recomposition
   You shouldnt have to ReCompose to ReLayout the Screen

=> To defer the read - We can use Lambda instead of direct value
