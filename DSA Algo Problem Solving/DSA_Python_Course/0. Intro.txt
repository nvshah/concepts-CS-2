* DS :
  --
  - diff ways to Organize Data on Computer So that it can be used effectively.

  Eg : Queue at Cinema 
       Stack of Book Piles 

* Algorithm :
  ----
   - set of steps to accomplish tasks 
   - set of rules for a computer to perform tasks 

   Eg Compression Algo  // to transmit video by Google 
      Graph Algo        // To Finnd Path on Map 
      Optimization & Schedulingn algo // NASA to arrange solar panels on International Space Station

   - Usefulness : Correctness, Efficiency

* Why ?
  ---
   input -> process -> output 

   To make this process efficient we need to optimize the process steps & 
   this can be done via DSA


* Example :
  ---
   Google Map   // Graph 
   Library-Books  // Organized (Dict)


* Types of DS :
  ---- 
   1. Primitive  2. Non-Primitive

   1. Primitive :- available in programming lang itself 
                   {int, float, string, character, boolean}
   
   2. Non-Primitive :- Combination of Primitve 
              \
               Linear & Non-Linear 

        Linear DS :- data arrange in Linear Sequential manner 
             \
              static & dynamic 
              
              static :- asscoiated Memory Locations are fixed at compilem time
                        Eg array

              dynamic :- associated Memory Locations are decided ar run time 
                        Eg LinkedList, Queue, Stack

        Non-Linear DS :- Tree, Graph


* Types of algorithms :
  -----
   - based on Problem Solving Approach 

   - Sorting Algo 
   - Searching Algo 

   - Recursive 
   - Divide & Conquer Algo 
   - Dynamic Prog Algo     -> (Memoization & used for Optimization Programming)
   - BruteForce Algo       -> (All possibilities)
   - Greedy Algo           -> (Optimization & Local prefer instead of Global)
   - Randomized Algo       -> (Use random number atleast once to make decision)
