* Tree
------
  DFS-BFS 


* Inorder Traversal :- Sorted Order  (from BST)
  PostOrder Traversal :- Reversed sorted order (from BST)

  Reverse Inorder Traversal :- ie Decreasing Order (from BST)

* Topological Sort :
  --------
   DAG :- Directed Acyclic Graph

   => PostOrder DFS = Topological Sort :- Gives you Reversed sorted string/result

   Visit 
   Path

* Backtracking :
  -------
   -> In a Decision Tree when we take any decision & follow path & cannot find answer 
      then we actually revert our decision (& backtrack) to exploree new decision

   -> When a choice can affect the future answers, Think something about Backtracking

* Cycle Detection & Floyd Algo :
  -----
   - Linked List | Graph 
   - Tortoise & rabbit (Fast & Slow Pointer)


* Djikstras Graph Algo :
  ----
  It is a Greedy Algorithm
