* Custom Data Structure & GC :
  -----------------
   -> When you implement a data structure of your own, then do remember to deallocate memory 
      (c/c++) to avoid memory leaks 

      Scenario :-
        Let say Stack, POP operation 
           -> the popped out object must be made null, so that it can be picked up by GC (java)
              asa no one is referencing it.


* Pre-Allocate Memory :
  ---------------
   -> If memory required is known earlier then don't do those at run time.
      As it may incur a optimization 


* When given range from 1 -< n :
  ------
   -> Use Cyclic Sort
       Eg - find missing number

[n largest or n smallest]
* Use HeapQ when need to find n largest or n smalleset elements
  (NOTE :- you can also use BST & Stack & Traversal Technique such as inorder)
  [Infact you can utilise any Tree based algorithm as well]
    
    - techniques :- heapq, quick-sort logic of partitioning

  => Whenever you want something like nth smallest or kth smallest from tree :
      then instead of using recursive approach its better to use iterative approach if possible 
      because We do not require To Traverse all node in tree & want to break inbetween


* Use Bucket Sort like technique for Counter kinda thing & when the values are bounded

* Use backtracking in case of Tree like problems

* pow() & log() are used in correspondence to each other 
   \
    pow can be derived using log() in Logarithmic time
    pow & log are inverse of each other in the sense


* Linked List - Middle :- using slow & fast pointer

* backtracking Problem  :- You commonly undo or reverse your decision

* Range Queries :
  --------
   -> If you want to find the sum of sub-array 
      you can consider finding the prefix-sum first

      Then you can find any sub-array sum in constant time

* Recursive vs Iterative :
  -------
   User Recursion only when its needed ie When you want to utilise the recursive call results
   if you are not going to utilise the Recursive Call Results & Just pass through all return statement

   then its preferred to use Iteration


* Dynamic Programming :
  --------
   -> You can have entire Matrix as DP 
      or
      You can have hash-set where matrix coordinates corresponds to cell val

* Greedy & Heap :
  -----
  -> Whenever you think of Greedy Solution
     You should first check for Heapq(ie Priority Queue) as a Data Structure in mind
     As
     It goes hand in hand with such cause

* For hash-map :
  ----
   -> use large Prime No as size of hash-map array so that hashing becomes efficient

   - Inorder to make Hashing efficient whilst chaining 
     use inital size as Large Prime Number (ie such as 769)

* BitMask & BruteForce :
  ----
  -> You can represent possible attempts of sub-sequences via Bit Manipulation
     or
     alternatively you can consider Backtracking !


* BFS vs DFS :
  ----

  BFS is more suitable for searching vertices closer to the given source.
  BFS is optimal for finding the shortest path.

  DFS is more suitable when there are solutions away from the source.
  DFS is not optimal for finding the shortest path.


* When you have something to group or partition :
  or When there is something related to Disjoint Set kinda Operation
  \
   You can consider Union-Find (Disjoint Set Data Structure)
