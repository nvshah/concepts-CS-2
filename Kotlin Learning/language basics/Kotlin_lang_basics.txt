[Kotlin Boxing Understanding] https://reneferrari.github.io/understand-boxing-in-kotlin/

-> Fun Fact : Lambda - derive from lambda calculus of Alonzo Church

_____________________________________________________________________

TIP - Unicode is the standard for mapping characters to numbers.
      A single mapping in Unicode is called a code point

    - init block is executed prior to constructor block.

    - Enum Classes used when state machine is required for impl.

=> To pass a named function as an argument to another function, you use the :: operator.

* Wrapper :
  --
   There are wrappers available for all primitives and the Object base class.

_____________________________________________________________________

* String templates :
  ----------
   -> Same as f strings in python

* Amazing When Expression : 
  -----------
   -> The power of a when expression comes from leveraging pattern matching to
       compare values using complex rules.
   -> It totally relies on branch-matching rather than 1 variable check among diff conditions
   
   -> You can omit variable after when i.e 
       when{//branch_1 -> ''
            //branch_2 -> ''}

* Range :
  ----
   A closed range can never be empty or empty ??
    -> It can be empty E.g 2..1 -> []
                           1..1 -> [1]

* Function parameters 
  ---- 
   -> Function parameters are constants by default, which means they can’t be modified.

* method reference operator, ::
   `::`
   -> used to assign method ref to a variable

* nothing :
  ----
   -> Functions can have a special Nothing return type to inform Kotlin that this function
      will never exit.


* += :
  ---
   -> You can use this to add element into array or list at the end

* Kotlin Pair Object :
  -----------
   Pair<T1, T2>()

    alternative : `to` infix notation i.e T1 to T2


=> Built-in Kotlin types such as String, Int, Double have efficient hash values out of the
   box.

* lambda (closure) :
  ----------
   -> a lambda can access, store and manipulate the value of any variable or constant 
      from the surrounding context, acting as a nested function
   
   * trailing lambda syntax. 
      _______________________
   => when the lambda is the final argument passed to a function.
      You can use it as a function block

      Eg fun f(i: Int, l: (Int, Int) -> Int){
           return l(i, 10)
         }

         //call
         f(20){a,b -> a+b}

    -> lambda is saied to capture the entities existing in the same scope where it is lying
       A lambda can capture the variables and constants from its surrounding context.

       {filter, map, fold, reduce}


  Pass a function as a reference :
  ----------
   ::funAnme

   => The :: operator is the reference operator


* Int::plus -
  ------
   -> refering the operator `+`

* value vs reference equality 
  -------------
   ==  : value equality    [ can be overriden by equal()]
   === : reference comparison (identity comparison) [if poiting same block of data on heap or not]
      
   REMEMBER :  For values which are represented as primitive types at runtime (for example, Int ), 
               the === equality check is equivalent to the == check.

   == -> checks for stack 
   === -> checks for heap

   to overcome the == i.e equality check at stack level :-
     override {hashCode(), equals()}


* Collections :
  ---------
   1) Array :-

     -> Boxed vs Non-Boxed 
      
        arrayOf() -> will generate list of Objects i.e (in case of primitve, value will be Boxed)

     NOTE :  Using primitive types over their boxed counterparts will consume less memory 
             and result in better performance

         Array<Int> -> Object array 

         IntArray, DoubleArray -> Primitve types array 
                                  They will initialize by their default values (i.e 0 in case of int)
         
         IntArray -> int[] -> array of primitive types 
                           -> no boxing occurs

         Array<Int> -> Integer[] -> array of objects(nuallable) -> TypedArray in Kotlin
                                 -> Boxing Occurs 
                                 -> Integer.valueOf() call to manually box a value 
         
         In Kotlin to Convert to Boxed/Wrapped/Typed Container :-
              -> `toTypedArray()`

   2) lists :-
     
      -> Unfortunately you can't use primitives with lists 

      -> the List type in Kotlin is an Interface
          Concrete realizations :- {ArrayList, LinkedList}


   * Hash values :-
     -------
      -> The hash value has to be deterministic — 
          meaning that a given value must always return the same hash value


  * cast safe :
  -------
   -> as? 

* reified :  
  -------
   -> used with inline functions

* Comparable :
  -------- 
   -> fun compareTo()   // this will decide total ordering 
  

---------------------------------

* Singletons :
  --------
  via `object` keyword
  - Use of
   singletons is sometimes discouraged because they introduce a global state into your
   application; therefore, you must be careful when accessing a singleton from different
   application threads. But singletons are useful in certain use cases wherein the scope of
   use is limited.

  - Shared Instance

* Anonymous objects | object expression
  --------
   -> Anonymous objects — or object expressions — let you create unnamed instances
      of interfaces and to override class behavior without subclassing.

   -> object are generally used to create namespaces.
    
* Object declarations :
  --------
   -> allow you to create Singletons inside Kotlins
   -> it has always an object name following object keyword

   - an object declaration is not an expression


* class-properties :
  -----
   => Properties are variables and constants that are part of a named type.

   delegated properties : observe, limit or lazily evaluate
   
   * Delegates.observable() 
   * Extension properties do not have backing fields, so you can only define them using custom accessors.

* Companions :
  ------
   -> object declaration inside class (with companion keyword)

   -> The companion object holds properties that are universal to all instances of a particular class
   -> static block in kotlin (alike but not actual static)

   -> simulate static keyword behaviour in kotlin 

   -> Note that even though the members of companion objects look like static members in other languages, 
      at runtime those are still instance members of real objects, and can, for example, implement interfaces


* namespace : (& Companions)
  --------
   -> The class with its companion object is said to act as a namespace

* extension :
  --------
   -> Augment existing behaviour of class

* static dispatch :
  -----------
   -> decision of which specific operation is decide at compile time.

* super :
  -----
   -> invoke the methods in nearest implementing superclass

* Nested & inner class :
  ------------
   NameSapce
   -> When a class is nested inside another, 
      it does not by default have access to the other members of the class 

   inner class :
   --------
    -> can access variables in it's enclosing scope/namespace of class.


* Sealed Classes :
  -----------
   -> The sealed classes themselves are abstract and cannot be instantiated.

      allow subtypes which can have multiple instances and have state.

      Kotlin sealed classes guarantee that there are no other implementations of the given class 
      outside of the file they're defined in
      each instance of a sealed class has a type from a limited set that is known when this class is compiled.
   
   =? Sealed classes are allowed to inherit only inside same package (i.e logical namespace)

* interface :
  ---------
   -> like an idea
      conform to someone (when implemented)

   -> You can store properties in an interface
      \
       either abstract or give an impl to property 
       (as interface cannot hold state so it cannot have backing field for property)

   -> is-a relation with interface of child
   
   -> multiple conformance (multiple inheritance of interface)

   => Interfaces allow you to declare information about what something does, 
      rather than what it is, as a class hierarchy would.


* Type erasure :
  -------
   -> You cannot use run time check for type T i.e Generic one as Compiler don't know at moment 

  Star Projection :
  ------
   -> replace T with * when you want to do any run time check.

   =>  Instead of actually getting information about the generic type, 
       it assumes it must be... some type, which could be nullable.

  reified :
  -----
   -> we can use class type as parmeter i.e with `is` & `as`, directly withour require `::` operator
   -> allow you to use a generic type, but retain information about that type.

gist -> `Type erasure` means that, within a class or interface that takes a generic type, 
        you won't have any information about that type at compile time unless you annotate the
        type with reified and inline the function.

* Covariant : 
  --------
   <out T>
   -> relation of objects that take the same generic type is similar to that of supertypes and subtypes
   -> List<Int> can be assigned to variable of type List<Number>

* ContraVariant :
  --------
   <in T> 
   -> supertype to subtype 

* Invariant :
  -------
   <T>
   -> cannot make any inference.

- FUNCTIONAL PROGRAMMING 

* Higer-Order Func :
  ---
   - Func that recieves other func as param or returns other func are known as higher-order func

* Lambda :
  ------
  - A lambda expression is always defined in curly brackets
  - The last expression in a lambda body determines the return type and the value that is returned 

  - it :
    --
    If a lambda has only one parameter, you don’t need to specify its name. 
    You can access it by using it as a name

  - In Kotlin, if a lambda is the last parameter of a function, 
    it can be placed outside of the parentheses of a higher-order function.

  - In Kotlin Lambda is internally (in java) is represented as a Class

  Returning from Lambdas :
  ---
   -> If you use a regular return expression inside a lambda, 
      you’ll return to the call site of the outer function.
      (because lambda act as an closure to its enclosinng scope)

  REMEMBER :
   Remember that, for each lambda that you create to pass to another function, 
   the Kotlin compiler generates an appropriate class extending FunctionN

* Closures :
  ------
   - Lambas (as well as local functions) act as closures, 
     which means that they can access and modify variables defined outside of their own scope

* Extension Func :
  -------
   - Add new functionalities without Inheritance
     - as multiple Inheritance is not allowed 
     - or class may be not extendable (ie Sealed Class or final Class)

   => extension function implicitly receives an instance of the extended class

* Lambdas with Recievers :
  -------
   -> You can pass extension function as an argument for lambda as well to function


* Qualified Return :
  -----
   use `return@qualifierName`

* Inline Function :
  -----
   -> In case of lmabda func if you use it multiple times & as its creating class underhood
      it may increase memory usage and have a performance impact on your application.

     To avoid such behavior, you can mark your function with the inline keyword, 
     which replaces the function call at the call site with the body of the function. 

   If you try to inline a function which doesn’t receive any lambdas as parameters, 
   then inlining has a high probability of being useless; 
   no extra classes get generated and there’s no need to inline the function
   
   - noinline
  
  crossinline
  ____ 
   -> avoid non local return (ie return from main parennt function)
   -> When lambda shouldnot allow nonlocal return (ie return without a label is not allowed) 

* tailrec :
  -----
   -> If last call of function is call to itself then it is called tail recursive
   -> You can mark such func as tailrec modifier

* infix :
  -----
   -> func with only 1 argument can be invoked as a statement directly

* Sequences :
  ------
   - generators | Iterators of python 
   - Lazy Iterable
