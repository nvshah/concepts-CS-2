* Cross Product of 2 vectors gives us a 3rd vector that is orthogonal to others

A dot B -> projection of A on B

Dot Product :- product of length of vectors that are moving together
               \
                -> A & B moving in B's direction

               - multiplying part of A that is going in same direction of B
               - how much they move in same direction

Cross Product :- multiplying part of A that is going in perpendicular direction of B
               - how much they move in perpendicular direction

               -> Will give you the Vector perpendicular to 2 existing Vectors 

* Tangent :
  ------
   -> is a Line that touches the Funnction at one Point
   -> It helps to find the Slope of an Equation
   -> It helps to determinne if Funnction is Growing or Degrading
