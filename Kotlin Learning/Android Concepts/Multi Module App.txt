Multi Module App
----------------

Tip :
- Never start with Multi-Module Setup
- Dont follow Layered based Modularization
  (Instead go for Task/Feature based Modularization)

-------------

Advantage :-

- Faster Gradle build
- Better Work Delegation among Team
  (2 teams can work on same app without changing each other code)

- seperation of concerns
- Reusability of Modules
