1. Intro MVC

Why MVC ??
-> Better Seperation of Concerns, hence more maintainable app

* Model : App level representation (independent of UI)  // POCO
* View  : html render
* Controller : resp for fetching api
* router: selects the right controller to handle the request

* Actions : Methods of controllers are referred to as Actions
   - action in controller is responsible for handling a request


[View and Action]
=> There should be View having same name as Action  // if you want to return ViewResult

* Routes (Custom)
  ---
  - Define most specific to most general

  -> You can introduce constraints to your route params via regexp

* Passsing data to View :
  --- 
  1. View(param)   // <--- Best approach
  2. ViewData dictionary // with a MagicString
  3. ViewBag  // at runtime
