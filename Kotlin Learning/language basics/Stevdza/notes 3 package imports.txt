notes 3 package imports

=> Its good practice to name your package name as same to your directories are placed

=> By default kotlin file will be located in <root> package, if package statement is not specified on first line 

* There can be only 1 unique classname under 1 package

* Is package & directory same thing  ?
  -> No
     package is logical name given to group your kotlin files
     whereas
     directory is physically exists in your computer memory

     However, its recommended to keep package name in sync with directory structure so as to avoid confusion
     & maintain good code readability
