Que -> What is dispatch reciever ?? 

* Annotations :
  ---------
   Eg @Composable -> 
     
     Tells kotlin to add more support to that functions

     @Volatile 
       writes to corresp property is available to other threads

* To get Java Class from Kotlin Objects :
  ----------
   -> .javaClass

* To get Class Object from class name i.e string  :
  ----------
   -> Class.forName('className')


* abstract class in kotlin can be invoked via ClassName() ??
-> how ? -> need to over

* You can use anonymouse object ie with {} for implementing the interface at run time
  also


* DeepRecursive Functions :
  ---
  - maintain their call stacks on Heap instead on Stack
  - to deal with recursion depth limitations


* cast Map to any key, val type
  ---
  -> arguments = Some Mapping
     arguments as Map<*,*>
