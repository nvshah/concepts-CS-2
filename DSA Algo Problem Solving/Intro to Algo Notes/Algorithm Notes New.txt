Algorithm Notes New
------------------

* Exponential Search :
  ---
  prereq :- Array must be sorted

  Step 1: We will find first the correct boundaries (ie left & Right End) via Exponential Pointer
  Step 2: We will then perform the Binary Search in the sub-list (ie l:e)

  T.C :- O(logn)
  S.C :- O(1)  // Iterative Binary Search

  Application :
  - Use for Unbounded Array (ie Arr of large size)
  - Works better than Binary Search
