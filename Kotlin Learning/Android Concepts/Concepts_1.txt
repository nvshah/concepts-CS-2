  -> English is a bridge language

  2 ways to change your lang settings
  1. Device Settings
  2. In App itself

  NOTE : Both must be in sync

  To declare your app supported languages
  -> in your app `AndroidManifest.xml` file
     add <locale-config>
     |
      -> This Xml-element will have list of App-Supported elements as its child nodes

  -> Android X & above -> user preferences for language to an app is automatically stored per app
     \
      -> For this you need to set "autoStoreLocale" to true in AndroidManifest file
         (This will delegate the Storage to androidX Pre-T

  -> Migrate to runtime API :- AppCompatDelegate
     Migrate Storage :- autoStoreLocales
     In Device Settings :- localeConfig


* Secure (Encrypted) Storage :
  --------
  Android :- KeyStore
  IOS :- KeyChain
