* Naviagtion Controller - control switching between screens
  
  Navigation Host - host the current route in itself
                  - It will keep all the routes & host the current one as per guided by nav controller

REMEMBER :- Each NavController must be associated with Single NavHost

----

- Way to represent the routes :- Sealed Class

navController.navigate()
             .popBackStack()

             popUpTo()


* Passing Arguments :
  -----
   - Reuqired & Optional 
   
   NavType


* Parcalebles :
  -----
   In navigation component of XML we were able to pass parcelables as argument 
   but 
   In case of compose it is not possible to pass parcelables as a argument in Navigation Compose
    \
     This is supported by third party library
       (library from rafel)

  Rafael Library for Navigation Compose :
  ------
   -> uses Navigator  (DestinationNavigator)
              \
               navigate()


Que) What is difference between navigation() & NavHost() ??
---
 navigation() -> construct nested navigation graph

 NavHost() -> 1 navController & holds many navigation()

* New back handler (Ahead of Time Back)
