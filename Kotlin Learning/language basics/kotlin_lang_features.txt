* Duration API :
  ------
   Eg 1.days


* Sealed Classes vs Enum vs Sealed Interfaces

* Sealed Class :
  ---
  - Abstract class
  - All the children (ie classes) that inherit from this class are known at compile time
    ie there are no other modules that can extends this class

  - generally members are singletons objects that inherits from this sealed class


  Sealed Interface :
  ---
  - If you do not have any specific info attached to base sealed class
    then you can use sealed interface instead

    As it allows to skip calling constructor when you extend the sealed interface
    (because interface do not have the constructors)
