Good Practice
------------

* API Keys :
  -> local.properties
     BuildConfig

     Dont submit it at remote (ie put in .gitignore)

* Single Activity

* BaseActivity & Delegation :
  ----
  -> Dont use BaseActivity (for Inheritance)  // as it may violates the Single Responsibility Principle
     |
     Use delegation instead !

  -> Delegation is Design Pattern You can use in any lang & Kotlin supports it natively
