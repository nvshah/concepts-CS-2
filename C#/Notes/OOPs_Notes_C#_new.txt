* Why static (in context to OOPS) :
  ---------

   -> class is a collection of unrelated methods and properties that are not related to each other.
      Thus it will not represent any real-world object
   
   -> So any kind of OOPS principles (Abstraction, Polymorphism, Inheritance, Encapsulation)
      will not be applied. (to static Classes)

   -> class with fixed behavior

   => We cannot apply any OOPs principles to the static class like inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction
