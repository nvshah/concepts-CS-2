* Clean Architecture :
  --------
------------------


------------------  

* UseCases :
  --------
   - sits between View Model & Data Layer
   - defiens a single thing user can do in your app
   - that uses repository pattern to communicate & utilise impl define in data layer
   - business logic is now part of UseCase (& not a View Model)

   - So we will inject usecases in View Model & not repository any more 

   -> UseCase primarily holds Business Logic for single Functionality 
   -> UseCase need not always need to access or get injected repository !
   
   - UseCase class can be maked invokable so as to resemble to function call  

   Tip : When you have many UseCases for Single Feature :- 
            - then wrap all those such usecases under single Wrapper (ie Sealed Class) ie FeatureUseCase Class 
              Wrapper class can be any type such as Sealed Class or Data Class

   Advantages :
    ---
    => Make Business Logic Code Reusable
    => Specify Business Logic at one Place 
    => `Screaming Architecture`
    => Prevent God View Model (way lot of code | bulky | Messy)

   Use Usecases whenn you have Complex Projects 
   If not then dont use (OverArctiectured)


* View Models ?
  ---------
   Q) What the hack VM does if Business Logic are covered by Usecases 

  View Models do :
   
   - Execute UseCases 
   - Provide the observables | states | LiveData | MobX | any kinda dynamic information 
     to the UI 

   - Map results to State




[Good Habbit] :- 
* Resource Class :
  -----
  Result Class :- A wrapper Class to Wrap Result 
    \
     Sealed Class with basically 2 States :- Success, Failure


* Do put your validation things in ViewModel & not in Presentation or UI side


DI : dependency injection 
 \
  - Inject Repository In View

* Single Activity Architecture Concept (instead of BaseActivity)

* Navigation Architecture Components
