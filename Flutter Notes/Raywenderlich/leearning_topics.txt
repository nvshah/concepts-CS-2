* Scrollable View 
   
   ListView & GridView
     \
      -> BoxScrollView - CustomScrollView - Sliver

   Slivers are just part of a scrollable area. 
   A benefit of using slivers is to lazily load items in as it scrolls into view. 
   This makes the list efficient, especially with a large number of children in your list.

   CustomScrollView
   PageView
   StaggeredGridView

   Use ScrollController and ScrollNotification to control or listen to scroll behavior.

* Barrel File 
    - Barrel files are handy to group imports together. They also let you import many widgets using a single file.

* Provider-Consumer

* uuid :
  ---
   - for random unique id generator

* Navigation - 
    - Navigator 1  (Imperative)
       - pop/push
       - comes under wrapper called WidgetsApp & MaterialApp extends WidgetsApp
    - Navigator 2  (Declarative)
       - router widget & router delegate
       - Use a router widget to listen to navigation state changes and configure your navigator’s list of pages.
       - the navigator widget holds a list of MaterialPage objects.
       - When the state changes, the router will reconfigure the navigator with a new set of pages

       - Back Button Dispatcher events

* Deep Link 
    - A deep link is a URL that navigates to a specific destination in your mobile app

    3 types :- 1) URI scheme
               2) IOS universal Links
               3) Android apps Links

    -> URI :-
              scheme:://path/queryparam?

    Main Idea :- Convert URL -> AppState
                 &
                 Convert AppState -> URL

    Navigation State :- conversion of url string into user defined data type is known as Navigation State (path + query param)
    Then you need to connect RouteInformationParser to your app (via Material())

    -> The app notifies RouteInformationProvider when there’s a new route.
    -> The provider passes the route information to RouteInformationParser to parse the URL string.
    -> The parser converts app state to and from a URL string.
    -> AppLink models the navigation state. It is a user-defined data type that encapsulates information about a URL string.

    packages :- beamer, etc are wrapper for navigator 2.0

* Shared Preferences :
  -----------
   There are three primary ways to save data to your device:

   1. Write formatted data, like JSON, to a file.
   2. Use a library or plugin to write simple data to a shared location.
   3. Use a SQLite database.

   => Note that this simple data saved to a shared location is lost when the user uninstalls the app.

   -> shared_preferences plugin gives you a quick way to persist and retrieve data,
   but it only supports saving simple properties like strings, numbers, and boolean values.

   -> Be aware that shared_preferences is not a good fit to store sensitive data.
   To store passwords or access tokens,
   check out the Android Keystore for Android and
   Keychain Services for iOS, or consider using the flutter_secure_storage plugin.

   - There are multiple ways to save data in an app: to files, in shared preferences and to a SQLite database.
   - Shared preferences are best used to store simple, key-value pairs of primitive types like strings, numbers and Booleans.
   - An example of when to use shared preferences is to save the tab a user is viewing, so the next time the user starts the app, they’re brought to the same tab.
   - The async/await keyword pair let you run asynchronous code off the main UI thread and then wait for the response. An example is getting an instance of SharedPreferences.
   - The shared_preferences plugin should not be used to hold sensitive data. Instead, consider using the flutter_secure_storage plugin.
