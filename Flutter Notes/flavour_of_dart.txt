Flavors of Dart :
-----------
 
 1) asynchronous programming -> Future & Streams, Completer, Timer

 2) parameters passing -> short syntax i.e this.fieldName 

 3) OOPS -> Mixins, factory constructs

            {super, this} - direct param reference in Constructor
            Constructor tear-Offs

 4) Every class is implementing its own implicit interface

 5) factory constructor redirection using '='
