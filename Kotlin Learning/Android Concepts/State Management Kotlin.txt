State Management

* Compose State vs StateFlow :
  --------------------------

  - Compose State is a mutable State Management (ie based on Live Data)
    whereas
    Stateflow is a immutable based on Streams (ie Flows)

  -> Compose State you can directly used in your UI as well by lazy init
     i.e `by mutableStateOf()` syntax

=> flow gives us operator :- map, filter, combine


* SavedStateHandle :
  ----
  - to restore state on occasion such as process death
