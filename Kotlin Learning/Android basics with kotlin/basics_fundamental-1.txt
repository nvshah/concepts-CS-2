-----------------------------------------------
=> context is the super class of Activity & Applicaition
   So you can pass Activity ref wherever the context is needed !

=> to get app level context you can use :- applicationContext
    |
    Eg When you want to observe the Connectivity Status (from Connectivity Service provided by the Android)

=> lifecycleScope is destroyed when the Activity is destroyed & not when activity/app is minimzed

=> Stateful Obj that maintains the backstack :- `NavController`

--------

* ui & controller ;
  --------
   XML & code need something between to communicate with :-
   & that is id of views in xml 

* Toast & Context :
  -------------
  context is an abstract class
   - You can pass Activity or Application class as those are subclass of Context class

   2 types of context :
   - Activity Context
   - Application Context


* fragments :
  --------
   - portion of screens, lighter than activities
   - layouts that can be replaced inside container


* Passing Data between Activities ;
  ---------------
  //Pass Data

   Intent().also{
     it.putExtra("name1", value1)
   }

  //Get Data 

   intent.getStringExtra()
         .getIntExtra()
  
    Serializable :
    -----------
    => Inorder to pass custom Object extends custom object with class -> `Serializable`

    `intent.getSerializableExtra() as T`

* Permissions :
  --------
   -> Access_Coarse_Location : permission of location in foreground of activity/app only.

   `ActivityCompat.checkPermision()`   //method that gives status

   Permissions To peek from :- `Manifest.permision.*`

   => requestCode : used to differentiate between several requested permissions 


* Alert Dialog :
  --------
    AlertDialog.Builder()


* RecyclerView :
  ---------

   NOTE ;- If you add new element to your list dynamically then use 

            adapter.notifyItemInserted(position)   // This will not rebuild entire recyclerview


* fragments :
  --------
   -> Light Weight 
   -> Static & Dynamic Fragment (i.e container that can add remove replace views in it.)

   => In Fragment the views are created after onCreate() is called.

   TIP :- pass Id of View in Fragment Constructor (that will do inflating of view for us)

         Eg class FFragment: Fragment(R.layout.fragment_F){}


  FrameLayout :
  ---------
   -> Can help to achieve dynamic fragment 
   -> display something at a single time.
   -> Used as Container for Fragment

   -> Layout that has only 1 child ata a time (ie alike Container)

* Nav-Graph :
  -----
   - The purpose of Nav-Graph is to define the transition between our fragments 
     i.e we can define from which fragment we can navigate to which fragment !

  
* Swipable Views :
  -------

   1) TabLayout
   2) ViewPager2

   Connect TabLayout with ViewPager2 :- 
      `TabLayoutMediator(tabLayout, viewPager){tab, pos -> }.attach()`

   tablayout.onTapSelectedListener()


* Shared Pref :
  -----------
    commit()  -> will put chnages synchronously, hence blocking main & UI thread 
    apply()   -> will do same task as commit() does but asynchronously [ not block main thread ]

    NOTE - use shared pref for small data only such as 
            App Settings, Game info, Walkthrough Config Info


* Notifications :
  -----------
   - set Notification behaviour with channel
   - use NotificationCompat to create notification for that channel
      \
       get system service of notification manager
        (We told another app to show notification pass through it)

     { channel id, channel name, }

     before oreo - no notification channel creation required.

     Tip -> 
      -- 
      // Check current version of android OS 
      Build.VERSION.SDK_INT >= Build.VERSION_Codes.O   //Oreo here

    NotificationManager

    --> get system service :- `getSystemService()`

    NotificationCompat.Builder()   // create notification for particular channel


  So here as mentioned earlier we are using system service and sending notification to other 
  app so that it can show it 

  pending Intent :
  -------------
   -> Allows another app to execute code inside our app.

   s1) - create our own Intent()
   s2) - create pending intent -> TaskStackBuilder.create(this).run{
     addNextIntentWithParentStack(intent)
     getPendingIntent(0, PendingIntent.FLAG_UPDATE_CURRENT)
   }

    addNextIntentWithParentStack(intent)   // allows us to fallback to intent when back button is pressed


* Intent service :
  --------- 
   -> Continue to service even when app is minimzed (i.e Work in Background)
   -> It will work on diff thread & not on UI/Main Thread
   -> If you want to use mutlithreading then you cannot use intent-service for that

   -> IntentWork Queue  // service will be processed 1 intent at a time.

   IntentService (extend this class)

  Que -> To interrupt current Thread :-
        \
         -> Thread.currentThread().interrupt()


  To tell our app that we have service & we are using it :-
    AndroidManifest.xml

    create `<service></service>` after activity tag


 NOTE -> Thread.sleep() // can throw InterruptedException

   startService()   // is used to start the Intent Service


* Service :
  ---
   IntentService will run in Seperate thread 
    but IntentService wont support mutlithreading 

   Service will support mutlithreading but It will run in main thread
   So you should manually start new Thread 

   We will start Service with some intent

   Tip :-
          use Thread{}.start()  to start service with heavy logic as Service by default run in main thread
      

   => Service will keep running until it's destroyed by System or itself
      IntentService will destroy automaticaaly once onHandleIntent() is completed


* BroadCast Reciever :
  -------------
   -> When any broadcast message is broadcasted by the android device system 
      Eg Aeroplane Mode On Off
         
         -> You can listen such updates via BroadCastReciever()
            
            
* Foreground Service vs background service :
  -------------
   Foregrounnd :- Notification
         \
          User is actively aware about the Service Running 
          - cannot be killed by Android system 
          - like activity inn foreground 
    

* Notification Channel :
  -----
   - To shown Notification 


* Pending Intent :
  ------
   -> Intent is meant for communication between service & Activity 
   -> Pending Intent is intent that can be started later

   - FLAG_UPDATE_CURRENT

* Implicit Intent :
  ----
   -> No components is provided explicitly
      instead System recognizes the component itself to show up for intent 
  
   - Eg Opening Web Url (WebView)

  Explicit Intnent :
  ---
   -> Component is required to be provided
   - eg Navigation between pages 


* Pending Intent & Broadcast Recievers :
  -----------------------------
  Broadcast Reciever are used to recieve the pending Intent (which is completed)

  -> You need to register the Reciever in the Manifest

  -> Pending Intent is Fired asa user perform some actions (ie Clicks)

  -> Pending Intent can fire Broadcast Reciever which You can recieve in your app



* Content Providers :
