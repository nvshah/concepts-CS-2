* Flow = Stream in Dart 

* Flow Operators :
  -----------
   - filter, map, onEach,
     
     count, reduce, fold

     flapMapMerge, flatMapConcat, flatMap

     buffer, conflate, latest

NOTE :- When collect is done with one val then only the flow will send next one

=> Normal flow with builder is called as Cold Flow 

* Cold Flow :
  -----
   -> do nothing when there are no collectors

* Hot Flows :
  -------
   -> If there are no collectors even then they are active 
    - ie value is lost & not retained if there is no one to collect 

   -> do sommething when there even no collectors

  
  1) StateFlow :
     ----
      -> to retain the state's val when screen is rotated (ie Activity is re-created)
      -> It will also do something when there are no collectors

      -> When only 1 event matters
  
  2) SharedFlow :
     ----
      -> Its used to send One-Time events (SnackBar)
      -> recieve events single time
      -> Can have multiple collectors
      - it waits till all active collectors collects val before sennding new val 
         \
          shared flow emitter suspend till all collectors collects 

      - There is options to replay ie cache

      -> when sequence of event matters
