-> Don't put all code in global Application(), i.e (World Readable World Writtable)

* ADB --
=> ShitDown App in Background (Emulator) via CMD
   goal - to simulate stop of android as if it was destroyed by OS in Background

   command :- `adb shell am kill <com.example.android.packageName>`

   ADB (Android Debug Bridge) is command line tool, and if you want to use it from the command line, 
   it needs to be part of your path. 
   First you’ll find where the adb executable lives, then you’ll add that to your path.

   general adb location :- {locationOfAndroidSdk}/platform-tools/

   NOTE :- add adb to system path/ Env Variables

   Remember : When in realtime System close app, it save some status of that app (which on resuming or restart is utilised)
              When OS destroy & resumes app, android tries its best to resume app in last state

* Bundle :-
   Bundle is manegd in RAM, so keep less manual data in it as much possible (i.e via onSaveInstanceState() callback)
   Generally You should store less than far 100 KBytes

- LifeCycle -> For Observing State Changes of Fragments/Activity

- OnSaveInstanceState -> Helps to Save State Change Manually, before when OS kills App

* LiveData :
  --------
    An Observable Data Holder class that is life-cycle aware
    - It's an mechanism that allows to communicate from ViewModel to Fragment

    - We get feature automaticaaly of Observable 


* Backend Property :
  ----------
   - Expose diff object in getter 


* CountDownTimer
  -------
   ref - https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/android/os/CountDownTimer
    

* Formatting String :
  ------
    ref : https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/resources/string-resource#formatting-strings

   1) Put String Format Entry in strings.xml
   2) Access that format as function in View i.e layout xml file via expression bindings


* Transforming LiveData :
  -----
    ref :- https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/lifecycle/Transformations#map(androidx.lifecycle.LiveData,%20androidx.arch.core.util.Function)
           https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/lifecycle/Transformations#switchMap(androidx.lifecycle.LiveData,%20androidx.arch.core.util.Function)
           https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/lifecycle/MediatorLiveData
    Transformations.map()
  

* Permissions :
   https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/permissions/overview


* LayoutInflator :
  ---
   To create View from code
   
   Remember : You need to pass `parent` that recycler gives us 

   => inflater.inflate() will return view  (i.e root view)

* Get Binding Object for specific Layout

   layoutObj.inflate()   // gives you binding object


* Access the View reference directly without findViewById() in kotlin 
  
  -> Just import this :-
        import kotlinx.android.synthetic.main.YOUR_LAYOUT_NAME.*/// HERE "YOUR_LAYOUT_NAME" IS YOUR LAYOUT NAME WHICH U HAVE INFLATED IN onCreate()/onCreateView() 


* THings to look for External Libraries : 
  ----------

   - which permissions are required by library
   - min sdk support


* Back Button Android :
  -------------
   -> In Navigation Graph :
        - select property popUpto

* Kill current activity :
  ----------
   -> finish()

* Safe Args :
  -------
   -> To get arguments passed :- `arguments` property 

   -> lazily :- `by navArgs<T>`
      non-lazy :- SeconArgs.fromBundle(arguments)


* Animation from backedn :
  -------
   Animation 
   AnimationUtils.loadAnimation()


* Stateflow observer in lifecycle scope :
  -------
   lifecycleScope.launchWhenStarted{} 

* For Firebase Cloud messaging :
  ----
   FirebaseInstancIdService


* Use GeoCoder -> to extract location information from coordinates
