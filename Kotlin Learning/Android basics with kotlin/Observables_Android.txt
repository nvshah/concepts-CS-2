-> Flow = Stream in Flutter

__________

* Observables in Android :
  ---------------

  1) LiveData
     
      - all observes will be notified abt current val whe triggered
      - It's LifeCycle-Aware (ie detect if activity in foreground)

  
  2) StateFlow 
      
      - Flow is based on Coroutine framework of Kotlin 
      - similar to LiveData

      Hot Flow :- keep emitting val even when there are no collector 
      Cold Flow :- Not emit when there is no collector 

      use stateFlow.collectLatest{}

      With StateFlow use .launchWhenStarted{}

      - automatically emit the val when activity recreates

  
  3) Flow 
     
      - Normal Flow (ie Just like Stream)
      - Normal Flow doesn't contain any state (it's like one time thing)
  
  4) SharedFlow 

      - Hot Flow (send data even when no collector)
      - Same as StateFlow but not emit same val again & again on screen rotation
      - One time event (alike Listener in Flutter)


* StateFlow vs LiveData :
  -------------------
   StateFlow has initial values always 
   whereas LiveData need not necessary have initial Value

   StateFlow keeps running when app is in Background
   LiveData is LifeCycle aware so it not 

   with StateFlow, We can have access to 
      Flow :- which allows us to modify the arriving data before Observing things

   Thinks of StateFLow as (We provide initial state in BLOC)

   StateFLow's collect() is same as LiveData's observe() function

   => Inorder to stop collecting as per LifeCycle then use StateFlow collection in LifecycleScope
      i.e `repeatOnLifeCycle()`
