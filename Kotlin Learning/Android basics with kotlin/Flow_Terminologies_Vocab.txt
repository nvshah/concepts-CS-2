* FLow :- flow is a Stream of data whose val can be computed asynchronously

* Entities :- 
     Producer :- Produces Values
     Consumer :- Consumes Values

     Intermediaries :- Rx Java kinda stuff filter, map, etc...
        \
         Modifies data from Producer & provides to COnsumer

=> With a flow coroutine builder, producer cannot emit val from some else coroutine context

2 ways Stream being Inactive
  
  1) Producer stops emitting val & Consumer ie. collect() stops     
  2) Consumer Stops collecing -> in turn stops producer from producing vals

=> Folds are cold & lazy if not specified intermediator operator 

=> To deal with exception we can use catch() intermediate exception
   
   catch() needs to be used before collect()

* collectAsStatWithLifeCycle() vs collectAsState()
