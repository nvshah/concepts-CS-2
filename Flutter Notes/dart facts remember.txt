* dynamic vs List<dynamic> :
  -------
   You can assign dynamic to any type in dart  (at runtime there can be err)

   You cannnot assign List<dynamic> to List<T> // It will give compile time err


* InternalLinkedHashMap vs Map 
  ------
   https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57845333/dart-how-internallinkedhashmapstring-dynamic-convert-to-mapstring-dynami

   When you try to cast List<dynamic> as List<Map> it will work 
   but 
   it does not go true for InternalLinkedHashMap


* Factory Constructor vs Generative Constructor :
  -------------------------
   - If you have either of constructor you will loose the default constructor definition
   - If parent class has only factory constructor then you cannot extend it
   
   -> When a class implements a interface, It do not require that Parent class must have Generative Constructor 
      but 
      If a class extends (ie Inherits) from Parent class 
      then inorder to utilise the Generative Constructor of Child Class it is required that 
      Parent class also must have atleast 1 Generative Constructor 
      else 
      Child class can define Factory only 

   Why ?
    -> During implements => Child class is creating its own solid base class (with all impl in its envelope)
      Whereas 
       During extendns (ie Inheritance) => Child class is creating its own attribs 
       but along with this its also invoking Parent class (it many be abstract or not) Constructor (probably Generative)
       & 
       for this innvocation it requires that Parent class also possess default Generative Constructor

   NOTE :- 
    Factories actually hide the implicit Default generators constructor availabl at hand for each class definition


* Field Innitialization in Dart is bit different :
  ------
   - When you define field at that moment its not get initialized but 
     if you refer that same field via this.fieldName then at that momment field gets initialized
