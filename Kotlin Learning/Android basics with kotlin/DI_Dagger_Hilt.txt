* 2 types of Injections are there
  - Constructor Injections
  - Field Injections

* annotations :
  ---
   @Module
   @Installin()   // live as long as specific activity

   @Singleton
   @Provides

   @AndroidEntryPoint

   @Inject
   @Named    // named annotation to provides
   @ActivityScoped  // single instance inside particular activity

   @ApplicationContext

   @ViewModelInject  // to inject dependencies in VM constructor

   @Qualifier    // To Resolve Same type of Dependency but having multiple sources or impl
   @Retention

* Dagger Hilt :
  ---------
   Create Modules 
        \
         contains dependencies that lives specific amt of time 

* If you want to inject in any activity then annotate that activity with @AndroidEntryPoint 

  If you want to inject inside Fragment 
  then also You need to mark the parent activity with @AndroidEntryPoint  


* View Model DI :
  ------
   by viewModels()   // Dagger will inject appropriate VM 

   @ViewModelInjection


* Multiple Function with Same type of Dependency Resolver in Module :
  - In such case create you own annotation to distinguish each dependency & scenario to use it
    via
    @Qualifier
    @Retention
