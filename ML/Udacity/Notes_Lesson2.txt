* ML - Intro :
  -------
    Computer can learn from data to dicover pattern & make predictions.

    Supervised Learning :
    -----
     -Labels | Output Values

    Unsupervised Learning :
    ----
     -non-labeled

  -> Model inspect data to discover patterns, in supervised & Unsupervised learnings.

    Reinforcement Learning : 
    ---
      Learn through consequences of actions in an environment

=> Nearly all tasks solved with machine learning involve three primary components:

A machine learning model
A model training algorithm
A model inference algorithm



=> goal :- Flexibility of Model is key

  1) Machine Learning Model 
     ---
      - generic program block

  2) Model Training Algorithm :
    -----
     - Determine changes needs to be made
     - Make Small changes to model

  3) Model Inference Algorithm :
    ----
     - Used to predict


* Major Steps in ML models : 
  --------
   1. define the problem & identify Approach
   2. Collect & prepare Dataset
   3. Train/Test Model 
   4. Deploy Model 
   5. Predict 


* ML task :
  ----
   - supervised or Unsupervised
      classification, regression or clustering

   - based on kind of data we can decide ML task


* Labeled data : data that already contains solution inside them, i.e label


--------

* Working With Data :
  --------
    Understanding the data
     
    4 ways :
     Data Collections  -> Data Inspection -> Summary -> Visualization

     -> summary statistics (see trends) & Data Visualization
         \
          Mean, Inner Quarter Range (IQR), Standard Deviation

    1) Data Collection :- SQL queries, Web Scrapping, etc...
    2) Data Inspection :- Quality of Data
                           {Outliers, missing/incomplete values, transformation}
    3) statistics      :- inline with assumptions, {mean, IQR, SD}
    4) Visualization   :- outliers & trends


* Training Model :
  --------
   -before training, you need to split your dataset
                                 \
                                  training, test

   What is model training ?
     - Iteratively update model parameters to minimize the loss function

   Model parameters :
   ----------
     - deteremines how our model behaves
     - weight or biases (based on context)

   Loss Function :
   _______
     How close model is from the goal (i.e measurement)

   Hyperparamters :
   _______
    - Cannot be change inbetween model training
    - affects how quickly or how reliably model trains
    - helps to estimate or derive model parameters


    Types :
      - Linear Model,   { Logistic, Regression }
      - Tree-based Models,  { XGBoost }
      - DeepLearning Model { Neural Network }
          \ 
           FFNN - Feed Forward NN 
           CNN  - Convolutional NN                          - processing images
           RNN/LSTM - Recurrent NN / Long Short Term Memory - processing seq of data
           Transformer - 


* bias-variance trade-off
  -------


* Evaluate the Model :
  -------
   precision & F1-Score

  * Log Loss :
    ________
     - helps to identify how uncertain model is about the predictions it is generating.
       uncertainty refers to how likely a model thinks the predictions being generated are to be correct.

       Log loss enables you to measure how strongly the model believes that its prediction is accurate
        
  Tools that can be used to evaluate Linear Regression Model : 

    1) MAE (Mean Absolute Error) :
    
    2) RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error):
         - val with larger error will recieve higher penalty
    
    3) R-Squared


* S5 Model Inference :



-------------

 Example : (gist)

  1) Dataset :

     1. collection
     2. Explored
     3. Cleaned
     4. Visualization             [to find trends in data]
     5. Split (training + test) 

  2) Model :
     
     Linear, 
     Python ML libraries (for training models)

  3) Evaluation :
     
     RMS (root mean squared error)
       - Improved model will have better RMS

     Sanity Check :
       Manual Thresold Check


    => Interpreting Results :
        - As model improves, better RMS result.

  4) Prediction :

      for real market (new values)        
      
  
* Linear Model & When to ???
  -----------

   -> If Trajectory is not linear, it's curved. Then any straight line would be invalid.
      & so linear regression is not suit here.

      But 

   Kernel Methods :
   -------
    -> Techniques do exist to modify your data so you can still use linear models in these situations. 
    Such methods are called kernel methods.


* UnSupervised Learning  :
  -------------------
    
    Transformation :
         Bags of Words :- 
         _____________ 
           -> transforms the data into another form

    Model : K-Means

    Evaluation Metric :- 
    
     Silhouette Coefficient
     _____________________
       -> helps to determine, how well data is clustered


* Supervised Learning : (Deep Neural Network)
  ---------------
   -> Deep Neural Network :
      
      CNN :- For images

      Evaluation Metrics For Neural Networks ???

        Precision & Recall.
