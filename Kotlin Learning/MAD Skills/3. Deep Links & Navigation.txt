- Disambigution Dialog

To test the Deep Link via Android Debug Bridge
=> adb shell am start -W -a android.intent.action.VIEW -d
_______________________

=> Deep Link allows to jump to middle of your app navigation
   whether its via Notification or Pending Intent


* What is Links ?
  -> A Uri that your app can act upon to quickly navigate to some part of your app

* URI := Scheme + Authority + Path

* Scheme :
  - In android you can use various scheme that can helps with several builtin intent

=> Deep Link doesnt have centralised registry of Ownership, So any app can sign up to handle a
   particular Deep Link

   (If your device has multiple apps that handles the same deep-link authority, then system
    will show disambiguity dialog)

* Path :
  - User can be directed to any portion of your app depending on the Path


* Web Links & Android App Uri Links

  Web Links :- http/https schemes

  Android App Links :- Web Links that are verified to belong to you app only !
                     - Handle autoVerify attribute (in Manifest File)

 -> Association between Web Sites & Android App Links


* Your App as a Handler :
  ----
  1. Add intent filter for incoming links to your manifest file



* NOTE :
  Intent-Filter :
   action.VIEW :- so that app can be reach from google search
   category.DEFAULT :- so that app can respinds to implicit Intent
   category.BROWSABLE :- allow to redirect to your app from clicking link in browser

  => Android System can starts your Activity via Intent-Filter Incoming

  -> You can test the intent-deep-link via Android Debug Bridge Debug Command
  => Package name can be skipped for Implicit Intent
     but
     Needed for an explicit Intent

Web Link :- Deep Links with Scheme -> http/https

* Android App Links :
  ----
  - To validate yourself as the owner of the Web Link you will setup an Android App Link
  - Android App Links are validate by the Host Domain of the Link (ie Authority)
  - Make sure you explicitly set autoVerify = true
     \
      to enable android app link verification for your app


* Implicit & Explicit Deep Links :
  -----
  Implicit -> Go to static place in an app

  Explicit -> dynamic Deep link (which uses Pending Intent to move to specific place in an app)
