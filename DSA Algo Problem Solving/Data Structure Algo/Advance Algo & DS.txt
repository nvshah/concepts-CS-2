Advance Algo & DS
-----------------

* Bloom Filters :
  ---
  - Space efficient Probabilistic DS

  to check if this elem is present in Set ?
  -> bloom filter will ans `firm No` or `probable yes`

  False Positive are possible -> (elem is not there but bloom filter says it is there)
  But
  False Negative is not possible -> (elem is there but bloom filter says its not is not possible)

  Tradeoff & Probabilistic Yes
  -> In bloom filter we've tradeoff between False Positives & Less accurate
  -> But it consumes lot less memory (as compare to hashtable, which provide perfect ans every time)

  Key point
  => We cannot remove item from Bloom filter (ie Its never forget)

  [Application]
  - Many OS uses bloom filter for disk lookup
  - Web Browser (like Chrome) uses Bloom Filter to identify Malicious URL !
     |
      -> If bloom filter returns probably Yes ans then more determined check is performed

  Ingredients
   - HashTable
   - Bit Bucket
