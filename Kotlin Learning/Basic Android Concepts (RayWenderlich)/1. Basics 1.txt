1. Basics 1
------------

* Activity := Each screen (in android) is known as an Activity and is built around a single task

* In the most general sense, any logic you add must come after calling setContentView()

- CountDownTimer, Toast

* LogCat -> Convention : ClassName + LogMessage

* Orientation| Configuration Changes :-
  ---------
  1. save any properties for Activity specified by the developer
  2. destroys the Activity
  3. Recreates the Activity for the new orientation by calling onCreate(), which resets any properties specified by the developer.

  Configuration Change :- when device lang change

  onSaveInstanceState() ->
    - called before configuration change happens, giving you chance to save anything imp.

  Bundle -> hashmap, which Android uses to pass values across different screens
