* Refactoring :
  ----

  1) All the classes, variables and functions are clear and self-explanatory
  2) All your classes have just one responsibility (files with 700+ lines are often a danger sign)
  3) Concrete implementations of classes are decoupled from your domain logic 
     (the core of your app's logic shouldn't depend on any libraries for example)
