Q |-> Why google introduce flutter despite they back heavily for Native(Kotlin) Android

!! -> Why Flutter ? -> Cross Platform | alike Unity behaviour (i.e rendering pixels swiftly)
      Why Google only introduce Flutter ? (As they already have Native+ Kotlin)


* Type Inference issue :

  When assign int to num variable inside extension{} block it's saying can't assign int to num

  But same thing when done outside i.e global scope it's allowing


  Eg extension on List{
     List add(num a = 0){}   // Not allowed to assign 0, we have to do 0 as num
  }

     num a = 0;   //allowed Why ??
