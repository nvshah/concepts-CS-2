1) Dependency Injection & Abstraction :
   -----
    Use DI ie locator to deal with which impl instance to create based on some 
    tags bool set 
    ie 
    Let Service decide the impl-choices

    but the consuming part ie Business Logic or Presentation should direct consumme that 
    service via single name regardless of underlying complexities ie impl-agnostic 


2) provider setup dart file 
   ------
    providers can be segregated into 3 categories 
      \
       - independent-services   // API 
       - dependent-services    
       - uiConsumableProviders
