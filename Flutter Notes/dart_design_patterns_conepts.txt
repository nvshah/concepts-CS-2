   Liskov Substitution Principle :- 
           The child class must not affect the parent class attributes/behaviours 
           The child class may introduce new behaviours but should not affect the Parent class behaviour 

           Child must perform in same way as parent (when domain is common)

  - Use abstract classes to define a base implementation for a set of related classes.
