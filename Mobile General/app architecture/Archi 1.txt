 Architecture : Data Layer (MAD Skills)

* Data Layer :
  -----
   - Responsoble for Managging the Data that app needs 
   - Repository + Business Logic + Centralized Logic 

   - Create Repository for each different type of data that you want in your APp 
      \
       - MoviesRepos, PayemntsRepos, ...

   - Repository :- communicate with Data Source to make data available to app as a Sinngle Source for Data
           - Data Source :- may be local or remote

   - Entry Point to Data Layer is always repository Classes

   - Data Exposed by Data layer must be Immutable
       \
        So that it is Safe also amongst Multi-Threading


* Multiple Level Of Repository :
  -------
   - Multipler Repository can share samme DatSource
   

* UI Layer :
  -----
   - visual representation of Application State (in the Data Layer)

   Responsibilities : (pipeline)
    1) Convert App Data -> UI Data 
    2) Convert UI data -> UI Elements 
    3) User Events -> UI Changes 

    4) Repeat 

    View Models = State Holders

   - Unidirectional Data Flow 

   -> While Collectig from Flow in UI, you must keep check that it only consumes when Activity is not dead
