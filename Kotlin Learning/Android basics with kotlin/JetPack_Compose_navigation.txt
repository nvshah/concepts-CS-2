* Passing Arguments :
  -----
   - Reuqired & Optional 
   
   NavType


* Parcalebles :
  -----
   In navigation component of XML we were able to pass parcelables as argument 
   but 
   In case of compose it is not possible to pass parcelables as a argument in Navigation Compose
    \
     This is supported by third party library
       (library from rafel)

  Rafael Library for Navigation Compose :
  ------
   -> uses Navigator  (DestinationNavigator)
              \
               navigate()
