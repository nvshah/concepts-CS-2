1) GANs with AWS DeepComposer :
   ------------
     
     - Generator 

     - Descriptor 
         \ 
          2 roles - classify as well as feedback
          So Descriptor itself update itself with time to perform better in classification


   What ??
    ->  A GAN is a type of generative machine learning model which pits two neural networks against each other to generate new content: 
        a generator and a discriminator.

        generator :
          - A generator is a neural network that learns to create new data resembling the source data on which it was trained.

        descriminator :
          - A discriminator is another neural network trained to differentiate between real and synthetic data.


      The generator and the discriminator are trained in alternating cycles. 
      The generator learns to produce more and more realistic data 
      while the discriminator iteratively gets better at learning to differentiate real data from the newly created data.


   Eg 

     Collaboration between an orchestra and its conductor

         The orchestra trains, practices, and tries to generate polished music, 
         and then the conductor works with them, as both judge and coach. 

   
   generator loss :
      
      -> The discriminator then takes these generated music tracks 
         and predicts how far they deviate from the real data present in the training dataset.
         this deviation is called generator loss

   => generator use feedback from descriminator to incrementally get better at creating realistic output


   descriminator loss :
      -> The discriminator measures the discriminator loss to evaluate how well it is differentiating between real and fake data.
