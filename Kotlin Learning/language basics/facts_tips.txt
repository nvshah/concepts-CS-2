* Generics & Boxing :
  ---------------
   -> generics can’t deal with primitives, 
      this leads to a lot of boxing and unboxing
      
      You can avoid this by marking the function as inline.

  Inline function : 
  -------------
   ->  Copying the function body and pasting it to the point where it is invoked. 


 
* Sealed Classes vs Enum Classes :
  ---------------------
   Sealed Classes - multiple instances of subclasses is possible
   Enum Class - shared instance of each case

   Sealed Class subclasses instances can store property whereas Enum Class Instances can't

   -> Enum can't have generic type parameter while Sealed Class can

   -> With Enum classes we deal with constants
      With Sealed Classes we deal with individual instances

* Inner class :
  ----------
   `inner` keyword :- 
     
     Allows nested class to access variables existing in it's enclosing namespace (i.e class)


* Abstract classes :
  -----------
   -> Cannot be instantiated but `this` is allowed in abstract class attributes

   Proxy Object :
   ------------

   -> The abstract keyword only ensures that, 
      when instantiated, it's instantiated in the form of a subclass.

* sealed classes :
  ---------------
  Though sealed classes are abstract by default as per Kotlin definition
  So the sealed classes cannot directly instantiated
  but
  They can be instantiated indirectly (i.e via super() call in child hierarchy)
  When some class inherit the sealed class, then during super call that sealed class is indirectly
  instantiated (ie this phenomenon is called proxy objects/instance)
  and
  also when any object is created on the fly without class definition for the same sealed class
  It is again indirectly instantiated

* Inheritance :
  ----------
   Fields Overriding :-
   --------------
   -> fields cannot be overridden but they can be hidden 
      i.e if you declare a field in a subclass with the same name as one in the superclass, 
      the superclass field can only be accessed using super or the superclasses type

      Fileds cant be overriden but are shadowed

MIMP ->>>
--------
  this & Inheritance & Abstract :
  --------------------------
   -> this referred to dynamic run time type of object by class hierarchy

      i.e `this` -> will refer to real object memory reference 
                    from that class to its ancestor (if any)


* Interface & Generics :
  ----------------
   -> used an interface to give your generic types more power.

* Generics Imp :
  ------------
   -> • A class with a generic constraint shouldn't need to know what specific type T is in
      order to be able to do things with it. 
      If it has to know what subtype it's holding, the point of generics is somewhat defeated

      To solve above use : Generics With Interface


* reference of Variable :
  -----
   To gain & pass the reference of Variable in kotlin use `::` operator before variable-identifier

* Delegation & `by` :
  -----
   Kotlin supports “delegation” design pattern by introducing a new keyword “by”.
   
  -> Delegation can be used instead of Inheritance for BaseActivity

  -> Proved to be good alternative to implementation inheritance !

===================================

* Some Kotlin Facts from designer of Kotlin :
  ----

- Data Classes :- less bloated & easy to consume
   
- Delegation Property : (Abstraction mechanism)
  -----------
   - helps you to get rid of repeatation of the lazy logic
   -> by lazy {}

- Extension methods in  kotlin  = Monkey Patching in Python

- Sealed class :
  ---
   - all sub classes are knownn early 
     so no required of else in when{}

-> Kotlin have lot more expression (in between functional & procedural tradition)

- when expression in kotlin = patternn matching python

- inline func :
  ------
   - can access eenclosing parent scope variable

- threads vs coroutine : 
  ----
   cost :- cheaper than thread

- @Volatile :
  -----
   -> makes the obj visible instantly to all other threads
   -> allow only 1 thread to accesss the property at a time.

- synchronied(){}  blocks allow you to access code one at a time among multiple
                   thread attempts


- override fun invoke()  // to make kotlin class callable/invokable


* Wrapper Class in Kotlin can be of any kind :- ie Sealed Class or Data Class 


* Mixin kinda concept in Kotlin :
  -------
  -> How can we inherit multiple classes
  -> NOTE : In kotlin only Single inheritance is allowed & you can implement multiple interfaces
  -> You can use Inheritance + Delegation of an Interface to achieve Mixin Kinda Concept

=> Typically a ViewModel exposes the Stateflow to the UI/Presentation

=> State Hoisting :- Keep state as low as possible
