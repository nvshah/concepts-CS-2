* Modulo :

* Multiplicative modulo inverse & Co-Primes :

* Co-Primes :- except 1 nothing in common

* Fermats Little Theorem :
  ------


* Chinese Remainder Theorem :


* HCF of eqn :
  -------
   ax + by = c 

   HCF of above eqn = min positive val for above eqn where a & b are int

   Thus 3x + 9y = 0
    ans = HCF(3, 9)

  if you are given 2 numbers a & b, HCF(a,b) = minimum val of equation of ax + by 
  where x & y can be any int you want
