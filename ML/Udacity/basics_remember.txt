* Nearly all machine learning algorithms operate on data as numbers or sequences of numbers

* True or false: Loss functions help us determine when to stop training a model.

* Use vector operations whenever possible (i.e numpy & pandas)
    = make computation faster

=> Great job! When finding the probabilities using a continuous distribution, 
   the probability of obtaining an exact value is zero
