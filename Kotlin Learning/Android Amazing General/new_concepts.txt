* System Back : (Ahead oF time)
  ----
  Prior to Android 13, System doesnt know Ahead of time if App handles the Back Button Events/Gestures
  So System was only aware of 2 Gestures i.e Home & Recency Button (Ahead of Time)

  With Android 13, there is introduction of Ahead-of-Time Model for Better Back for Android

  System will now know ahead of time what to do on certain things (ie Predictable Back)

  New API :- onBackInvokedCallback{}
     \
      - If you override the method of this interface, then System (Android) will let you handle the
        Back press

  Each Activity has OnBackPressedDispatcher.onBackPressed()
    \
     Activity is from AndroidX

  => Each Fragment has its own NestedFragmentManager & thus has its own BackStack

  In Compose it is

  BackHandler() Api


* Per App Language Preferences :
--------------------------
  (new feature in 13+)

  Centralized Location in Phone settings to configure the language preferences per-app

  locales_confog.xml file  // to specify the lanugage supported by the app

  then you need to register this locales_config in Manifest under <application>
  tag as an attribute

  android:localeConfig="@xml/locales_config">

  To manually change the language of an app (progamatically)
  -->
  context.getSystemService(LocaleManager::class.java).applicationLocales
  or
  AppCompatDelegate.setApplicationLocales()  // for < 12 ie older api

  REMEMBER :-
  [To persist lang change in older device]
  You need to register `AppLocalesMetaDataHolderService` in android manifest
  inorder to support this feature in your older android version (ie < 12)
