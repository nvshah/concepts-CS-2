* Assemblies (.dll or .exe)
  ----
   - Assemblies are the building block of .NET Framework applications; 
     they form the fundamental unit of deployment

   - Assembly is nothing but a precompiled .NET Code that can be run by CLR (Common Language Runtime).

   - an assembly is nothing but a single unit of deployment or it is a precompiled chunk of code 
     that can be executed by CLR.

   Console Application :- .exe 
   Web App Project / Class Library Project :- .Dll

   1) EXE :
      ---
       EXE is an executable file and can run by itself as an application.

   2) DLL :
      ---
       -> DLL cannot run by itself. It needs a consumer who is going to invoke it.
       -  DLL is run inside another memory space
          This other memory space can be Windows/Console/Web Application

       - The reason behind the DLL is reusability. 

   Diff between EXE & DLL :
   ---
    -> the difference between them is an EXE is an executable file and can run by itself as an application 
       whereas DLL is usually consumed by an EXE or by another DLL and we cannot run or execute DLL directly.


* App Domain :
  -----
   -> The App Domain (Application Domain) is a logically isolated container inside a process
   -  logically isolated container inside which the .NET Code runs  
   -> Note: By default always there is an App Domain under which our .NET Code runs.

   Advantage :-
     - Can load Third Party DLL inside this container without affecting the own files 
     - Easy to manage diff version of .DLL


* Assembly :
  ----
   Equi to Packages in Python (ie Collection of Modules/nameSpaces)


* IIS :
  ---
   - Its a Windows Application 
   - It allows any Windows System to become Host & Serve an applicationn as Public via Public IP

   For Linux : PHP -> Apache Server 
               Windows -> IIS
   
   - Web Server Application Hosting on Window System

Q1) Diff between aspx, asxc, asmx ??

  .aspx: The file extension of Web page.
         webpage provides a graphical user interface (text, images, buttons, etc.), using which you can design the page which will be rendered to user on browser

  .ascx: The file name extension for the user control.
         User controls works as containers into which you can put markup and Web server controls. You can reuse this user control as a normal control across the application in web pages (.aspx files)

  .asmx: The file extension of web service page.
         web service does not provide a graphical user interface. It is mainly used to fetch data and perform actions.
