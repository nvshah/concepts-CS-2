* var args in c# -> `params`

* the addition operation overflowed the allowed values of integers.

* facts :
  -----
   -> To get MachineName :- System.Environment.MachineName

   -> Max size of int   :- int.MaxValue

   -> to get size of any datatype :- `sizeof()`


* const vs static :
  ----
   -> The only difference between a static and constant variable is that 
     the static variable value can be modified but a constant variable value can never be modified.


* const vs read-only ;
  ----
   -> A constant variable is a fixed value for the complete class whereas 
     a read-only variable is a fixed value but specific to one object of the class.

* == vs Equals() :
  ----
   -> Reference variables are created on the stack and they point to the actual objects which are stored in the heap

REMEMBER : 
  - If two objects have reference equality, then they also have value equality, 
    but value equality does not guarantee reference equality.

* Convert.ToString() vs ToString() :
  -----
   -> Convert.ToString() method handles null, while the ToString() method doesn’t handle the Null and throws an exception

* checked vs unchecked arithmmetic :
  ----
   In simple words, we can say that the checked keyword is used in scenarios where you want to ensure that your left hand side data type is not getting overflow

   unchecked :-- need 
         -> If you want to bypass this behavior at compile time then you need to use the unchecked keyword in C#


[IMP]
* Stack, Heap & GC :
  -----------------
   -> When any method is called 
      then its - value type variable are allocated on Stack
               - reference type is allocated on heap 

      Now when method is done ie reach last `}`
      then stack will be emptied
      but Obj created on Heap will not 
      So GC's role is to sweep out obj present on Heap

  => heap memory will be de-allocated by the garbage collector.

  => The memory allocation which is done on the stack is gone 
     when the control moves out from the method i.e once the method completes its execution.


* Value Type :
  ----
   -> Primitive Types 
   -> types that hold both data and memory in the same location

* Reference Types :
  ----
   -> a reference type is a type that has a pointer that points to the actual memory location.


----

* Class-OOPS 

* Static Constructor :
  ----
   -> can be thought of as lazy Factory/Singleton

=> Explicit call to Destructor via GC :- GC.Collect() 

* Types & Type Members:
  -----
   Types :- {Classes, Structs, Ennums, Interfaces, Delegates, }

   Type Members :- { }

* Internal & Access Modifier :
  ------------
   Assembly = Class Library Project

   Class Library := collections of classes 

   -> Internal allowed per .dll files

* protected internal :
  ------------
   -> allows internal variables to be accessed in sub-class of diff assemmbly as well

* Polymorphism :
  -----
   1 CompileTime / Early Binding / Static : Method Overloading
   2. RunTime / Late Binding / Dynnamic : Method Overriding 


   Method Overloading vs Overriding vs Hiding :
   ------------------------------------------
    Overloading :- diff params 
    Overriding :- virtual, abstract 
    Hiding :- new

* Method Overrdiding vs Method Hiding :
  ------------------------
  [Overrdiding]
  In Method Overriding parent class gives permission for its child class to override the method 
  by declaring it as virtual.

  [Hiding]
  In Method hiding also, the parent class methods redefined under the child classes 
  re-implement the method in the child class by using the ‘new‘ keyword.

  [Poly behaviour]
  In method overriding a base class reference variable pointing to a child class object 
  will invoke the overridden method in the child class. 
  In method hiding a base class reference variable pointing to a child class object 
  will invoke the hidden method in the base class.


* Partial Methods :
  -------
   REMEMBER 
    - The implementation of a partial method is optional. 
    If we don’t provide the implementation, 
    the compiler removes the signature and all calls to the method.

* Sealed Class :
  --------
   - Bottom Most Class in hierarchy


* Extension Methods :
  ----
   - Extension methods must be defined only under the static class.
   - The first parameter of an extension method is known as the binding parameter 
     which should be the name of the class to which the method has to be bound and 
     the binding parameter should be prefixed with this keyword.

* Interface :
  ----

* Explicit Interface Implementation  
  ----
  Whenever you implement multiple interfaces, 
  still you are allowed to access methods from all interface class via implementing class
  but if you want to restrict the corresponding interface methods called by corresponding type obj specifically, then you need to do explicit interface implementation.
