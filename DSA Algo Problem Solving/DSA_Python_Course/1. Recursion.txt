* Recurrsion :
  ---------
   -> Function callinng itself
   
   - Performing the same operation multiple times with different inputs
   - each time make inputs smaller thus making problem smaller 
   - need some base cases to terminate the recursion


* 3 Steps :
  ----
   1) Recurssive Case 
   2) Base Case (Stopping Condition)
   3) Constraints | Edge Case ( Stopping Condition)   // often `assert` is used
