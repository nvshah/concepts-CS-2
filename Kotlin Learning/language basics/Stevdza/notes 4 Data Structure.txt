notes 4 Data Structure

Prefer
- val instead of var
- listOf() instead of mutableListOf()

____

* list :
  ----
  List, MutableList

> Immutable list helps to reduce bugs in the code

* Puzzle operator (+=) :
   -----
   -> Its creating new list instead of inplace modification

* list vs array :
  - array is special low-level support
  - also for compatibility with prog lang such as java
  - array is used in case of varargs


* vararg & spread operator :
  ------
  - we cannot add more than 1 vararg parameter
  - vararg argument are accessed using the parameter name, which becomes Array

  spread operator (*)	
  - used to pass whole array into another existing array
