Overall Glimpse

NotificationManager -> NotificationBuilder -> NotificationStyle

------

* NotificationCompat.Builder()
  NotificationManagerCompat
  NotificationChannel

=> priority levels : matters for API levels (before & after API 26)

1) Builder :
  - needs the channel-Id

    API : NotificationCompat.Builder()

  - Can control level of details displayed in Lock Screen
     -> setVisibility()

  - Importance Level - decides if to notify with sound & with what intensity

  - onGoing : true // will not allow to get rid off the Notification via Swiping

2) Manager :
   -
   -> You must create NotificationChannel prior to posting any Notifications

   -> Manager will notify() to device for pushback notification
       \
        here builder will help to create a notification

      Manager can also canel() the notification

-> Builder depands on Manager & Manager creates a Notification Channel
-> Creating exisitng notification channel (same) again, performs no operations
-> User can define what is the importance level for given channel


* Sensetive Notifications
  ---
  - when locked is enabled

  NOTE :-
   You can display different content for same notification based on Screen is locked or unlocked
   (ie concept of private & public notifications visibility)


* Action Button on Notification & BroadCast Reciever :
  -------------------------------------------------

  Broadcast Reciever
  -> used to recieve some kinda message from Android System (ie OS) itself or
     some other application as well

  Reciever Element :
  - need to add reciever element inside AndroidManifest.xml file below <application> element

  Pending Intent :
  -> Notify Broadcast reciver when action is performed

  - PendingIntent.getBroadcast()  // if we use Broadcast reciever


* Notification & DeepLink
  ---------------
  - Trigger activity directly from Notification & open specific screen

  - Pending Intent

  addNextIntentWithParentStack()  // to maintain after Deep Link Navigation
   \
    Helps to create a BackStack
    &
    Which Deep Link to include whenever we open our MainActivity


* Progress Bar & Held Notification :
  -----


* Direct Reply :
  ---
  RemoteInput.Builder()
  NotificationCompat.MessagingStyle()  -?
  Person
  NotificationCompat.Action

  Broadcast Reciever -> will recieve the direct reply when user send from notification

  Flag -> Mutable for this functionality

  There are different NotificationStyle out of which 1 is MessagingStyle

  MessagingStyle
  --------
   USECASE :- Message recieved from specific User/Person

   -> will then be defined for each Person/user

  Overall Flow
  ____________
  NotificationManager -> NotificationBuilder -> NotificationStyle -> MessagingStyle -> Person -> Message
